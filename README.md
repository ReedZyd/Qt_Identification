# Qt_Identification

A real-time face recognition and age estimation system. 

## Intro

The system uses Seta Face as the core algorithm for face recognition and SSR-Net for age estimation.
The human-computer interaction interface is written based on Qt, and the overall system is implemented on a 43-inch vertical all-in-one. In addition, a parallel execution of face recognition and age estimation is carried out by multi-thread technology.
